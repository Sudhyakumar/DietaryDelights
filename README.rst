## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

My app allows you to find new recipes that cater to your specific diet. For example, if you would like to find some gluten free pasta recipes, then look no further. The output the top 4 recipes that cater to your dietary restrictions. There are also prices for how much the recipe would cost you to make. You can convert these prices to different currencies using the dropdown at the top.
My first API that I used is Spoonacular which returns the recipe information. My second API is Exchangerate.host which converts the price to different currencies. They are connected because someone may want to check out how much the recipe is going to cost them before going out to buy the ingredients. Also not everyone lives in the US so my app allows people from many parts of the world to have the chance to find new recipes.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned how to combine multiple APIs into one project. I learned to think creatively and problem solve my way through challenges such as using different API that are formatted differently. My first API, Spoonacular, was especially challenging for me to figure out. I was trying to figure out the best way to effeciently make the least amount of calls but also make a functioning code.
