My app allows you to find new recipes that cater to your specific diet. For example, if you would like to find some gluten free pasta recipes, then look no further. The output the top 4 recipes that cater to your dietary restrictions. There are also prices for how much the recipe would cost you to make. You can convert these prices to different currencies using the dropdown at the top.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned how to combine multiple APIs into one project. I learned to think creatively and problem solve my way through challenges such as using different API that are formatted differently. My first API, Spoonacular, was especially challenging for me to figure out. I was trying to figure out the best way to effeciently make the least amount of calls but also make a functioning code.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start over, I would have more countries to convert my prices to. I would also want to add more colors to my GUI.
